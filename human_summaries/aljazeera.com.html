<body bgcolor="white"><a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Obama opened on a historic note, echoing John F Kennedy’s phrase that the executive and the legislative branches are "partners for progress"</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Obama said that "there is much progress to report", citing the end of the war in Iraq, a rebounding economy and a retreat from the crises of the past</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>  He began his policy prescriptions by claiming that bolstering the middle class was key for economic growth</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>  Equality of opportunity was a notable theme from his opening remarks, arguing that government must work "on behalf of the many, and not just the few"</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>  Obama proceeded to prod Congress on the need to foster bipartisanship and put the interests of the nation before party - in anticipation of his remarks on the budget and deficit</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>  Praising efforts that have reduced the deficit by $2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>5trillion, Obama denounced the "sequester", and any potential solution privileging military spending over discretionary and entitlement spending</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>  Obama conceded that the biggest driver of long-term debt was the cost of healthcare for the elderly and called for modest reforms that leave seniors with onerous sacrifices</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>  The president’s agenda was one of fairness, asking all quarters of American society to absorb the costs of deficit reduction</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>  On Medicare, the president pledged to enact reforms that would mirror the savings proposed by the Simpson-Bowles commission - by reducing taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies, asking more from wealthy seniors and tying the price of healthcare to measures of quality</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>  Arguing for increased scrutiny in the tax code, Obama echoed the theme of fairness, implying growth and fairness are interconnected</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> He proposed, appealing to both parties, a simpler tax code which would not contain loopholes for the wealthy and would create incentives for companies creating jobs in America</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>  "The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>" However, it is a growing economy, and not simply deficit reduction that should be the aim of the United States, argued Obama</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> The three policy proposals for higher levels of growth were attracting more jobs, equipping individuals with the right skills and ensuring workers are paid fairly</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>  Obama appealed to both parties by claiming that all proposals he laid out for increased growth were fully paid for and would not increase the deficit</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>  To make America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing, the President proposed fifteen new manufacturing hubs that would turn depressed regions into global centres of hi-tech jobs</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>  "Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>" Obama called for additional science and research spending and elaborated the threat of climate change, asking Congress to take on a market-based solution to the challenge it poses, and claiming that if they did not act, he would</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>  He proposed using oil and gas revenues to create an Energy Security Trust that would free Americans from dependence on oil and increase innovation in the sphere of clean energy</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> He also laid out the goal to cut in half the energy wasted by homes and businesses in the next two decades through a partnership with the states</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>  Obama criticised America’s aging infrastructure as a hindrance to growth, proposing a "Fix-it-First" program to carry out the most urgent repairs needed in the country, in addition to a "Partnership to Rebuild America" by seeking private capital to renew infrastructure</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>  Obama argued that a bipartisan effort to help Americans to refinance their mortgages is critical and would be accepted by him immediately</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>  The president pushed hard on the need to boost early education efforts by instituting a national preschool program, investments he claimed would mean future savings</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>  Obama additionally asked Congress to change the Higher Education Act to make affordability and value parameters for federal aid, and announced the release of a scorecard ranking colleges by getting "the most bang for your educational buck"</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>  "The time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>" Obama called for enhanced border security, pathways to citizenship and the rectification of the legal immigration framework as the keys to any comprehensive immigration reform bill</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>  The President urged the House to pass the Domestic Violence Against Women Act, as well as asking Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> An additional policy recommendation was to raise the minimum wage</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>  "Tonight, let’s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>00 an hour</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>" Obama announced that America will soon end its mission in Afghanistan and defeat the core of al-Qaeda</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> 34,000 troops will return this year, he said, and by the end of next year, the war will be over</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> The American commitment to Afghanistan would include training for Afghan forces, and counterterrorism efforts to pursue enemies of America</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>  Obama then claimed that his administration has created a transparent and "durable" counter-terrorism policy, and will continue to engage Congress to ensure American counter-terrorism policies are consistent with the letter of the law</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>  He stated that America would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and that it would take threats from cyber-attacks much more seriously</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>  Obama said that the US will aim to eradicate extreme poverty and AIDS, and strive to be a beacon of the ideal of democracy and self-governance to citizens of all countries</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> To raucous applause, he said that the US would stand steadfast with Israel</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>  He discussed the right to vote and the difficulty voting has taken on in recent times, announcing a non-partisan commission to improve voting conditions in America</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>  "This time it’s different," said the President, on the topic of gun control, advocating common-sense reform such as background checks, gun resale limitations and controls on assault weapons and oversized magazine clips</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>  "In the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>" Giving the example of fifteen-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who, after performing at Obama’s inauguration, was shot dead in Chicago, he repeated the phrase, "they deserve a vote", to wild applause</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>  He concluded his speech on the values of and the obligations to citizenship, giving the example of a number of citizens who demonstrate self-sacrifice and civic virtue</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>  "We are citizens</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46> It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legal status</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47> It describes the way we’re made</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48> It describes what we believe</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49> It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations; that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter in our American story</a>
