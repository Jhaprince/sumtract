<body bgcolor="white"><a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Transportation & Infrastructure: Obama wants "a long-term increase" in surface transportation and rail funding "financed by reductions in spending due to ending the wars," which would mark a "major commitment to nation building here at home</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>" He also called for $50 billion in "frontloaded" infrastructure investment, which would include $40 billion reserved for a "Fix-It-First" program to address urgent infrastructure repairs like "the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>"  To make sure "taxpayers don’t shoulder the whole burden," Obama called on greater private sector investment, stating "I’m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: modern ports to move our goods; modern pipelines to withstand a storm; modern schools worthy of our children</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>" So far, not much is known about how the program might be structured, though "it could have elements of an infrastructure bank, which is also designed to leverage public and private capital," according to Politico</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The additional documents say the program is intended to "increase private-sector investment that will create jobs upgrading critical business infrastructure, such as our transportation system, our power grid and our oil and gas pipelines</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>"  Climate Change: On climate change, President Obama insisted the nation should act "before it’s too late</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>" He stated: "But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Yes, it’s true that no single event makes a trend</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods – all are now more frequent and intense</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science – and act before it’s too late</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>"  Obama urged Congress to "pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change," specifically mentioning efforts by Sen</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> John McCain and former Sen</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Joe Lieberman</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> However, he insisted that if Congress didn’t act soon, he would, directing his Cabinet "to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>"  Energy: "After years of talking about it, we are finally poised to control our own energy future," Obama stated</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> "We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar – with tens of thousands of good, American jobs to show for it</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> We produce more natural gas than ever before – and nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>"  The President’s energy plan includes an "all-of-the-above" approach to invest in homegrown energy sources so that we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil, create jobs and home and cute the cost of energy for families and businesses while taking "significant action to address climate change</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>" Obama also urged Americans to work towards cutting in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next twenty years, promising federal supports to projects that will create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> Finally, he called on Congress to make the renewable energy Production Tax Credit permanent and refundable, as part of comprehensive corporate tax reform, providing incentives and certainty for investments in new clean energy</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>  Oil & Gas: Obama praised the natural gas boom for leading the country to "cleaner power and greater energy independence," stating that for that reason, his Administration "will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>" But he also said that he wants to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology to help natural gas burn cleaner while protecting air and water</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> Obama proposed that revenue from oil and gas production on public land go towards an "Energy Security Trust" that will spend money on new research and technology to help wean Americans off oil, while focusing on electrification, biofuels and natural gas fuels</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>  "Indeed, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29> So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> If a non-partisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31> Let’s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we’ve put up with for far too long</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>"  Defense: The president announced that an additional 34,000 U</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>S</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> troops would be returning from Afghanistan over the next year, and vowed to continue on with light-footprint counterterrorism operations across the globe</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> "We will need to help countries like Yemen, Libya and Somalia provide for their own security and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali," the president continued</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36> "And, where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>" Obama also committed to doing "what is necessary" to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and warned North Korea</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>  Sequestration: "These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> They’d devastate priorities like education, energy, and medical research</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40> They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41> That’s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>"</a>
