<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> deficit and debt</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> However, he made it clear he would not do it at the expense of Social Security and Medicare, which protects the "generation who built this country</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>" He promised to cut the same amount from Medicare as recommended in the Simpson-Bowles Report</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Part of the savings already comes from lower health care costs, thanks to Obamacare</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The rest will come from reducing taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and "asking more from the wealthiest seniors</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>" The third cost savings will come from basing Medicare payments on quality of care, not quantity of tests</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>  Tax Code Overhaul:  Second, Obama talked about protecting the middle class</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Raise level of R&D to that seen during the space race</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> Partnership to Rebuild America to attract private investment</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> Pass the rest of the American Jobs Act</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> Raise the Federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, and allow it to increase with the cost of living</a>

<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25> Obama asked Congress to adopt a proposal to address alternative energy</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26> If they don't, he will ask his Cabinet to do so</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27> In addition, he pledged to: Speed up new oil and gas permits</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28> Support R&D to help energy burn cleaner</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29> Use Federal energy tax revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust to drive new R&D needed to shift cars and trucks off oil for good</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30> Cut in half energy wasted in U</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>S</a>

<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>  Immigration Reform:  Obama said the time had come to pass comprehensive immigration law reform</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34> This means stronger border security, including more boots on the border</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35> It offers the 11 million illegal immigrants a path to citizenship if they learn English, pass a criminal background check, and pay any back taxes</a>

<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37> It also means revamping the legal immigration process to allow top-quality immigrants</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38> Finally, the bill combines a crackdown on businesses who hire illegal workers with a legitimate guest worker program</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39> This bill will probably pass, since the 2012 Presidential Election showed Republicans the growing power of Hispanic voters</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40> The opposition does not want to reward illegal immigrants with amnesty</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41> For more, see The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>  Education:  Sixth, Obama proposed a preschool education program that will work with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child in America</a>

<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44> The Federal government will also work with states to establish partnerships with companies to provide training in math, science and high tech to high school students so they can graduate and get good jobs</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45> Obama also asked Congress to change the Higher Education Act to reward federal aid to those schools that also demonstrate affordability and value with federal aid</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46> He will also release a "College Scorecard" for parents and students can use to find schools that offer the best value</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>  Defense and Foreign Trade:  Obama said the U</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>S</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49> will bring home another 30,000 troops from Afghanistan this year, and shift to training and anti-terrorist training next year</a>

<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52> He also promised to strengthen peaceful alliances with those who want democracy, keep pressure on Iran and Syria, and stand steadfast with Israel</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53> He promised to maintain the best military the world has even known and reduce inefficiencies in defense spending</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54> He also promised to support families of both gays and straights, women in combat and invest in Veterans Affairs to support wounded warriors</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>  "They Deserve a Vote":  Obama asked Congress to vote on his gun control proposals, saying that all the victims of gun violence deserve at least a vote</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56> Obama's proposals include background checks for all gun sales, reinstating the 1994 ban on assault weapons, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, and banning the possession of armor-piercing bullets by anyone other than the military and law enforcement</a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57> The proposal also includes more help for the mentally ill, training for school preparedness and more coordination between Federal agencies</a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58> Obama is willing to take on the National Rifle Association, which advocates increased police presence at public schools as the solution</a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>  Economic Impact:  Many of these bills and initiatives will be difficult to pass, given that the first several months may be consumed with negotiating with Congress on raising the debt ceiling and cutting spending</a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60> Although Obama said he will not negotiate the budget as part of the debt ceiling debate, Tea Party-Republicans see this as a potential source of leverage to get the White House to make key spending concessions</a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61> However, Obama won't engage in a debate that could recreate the 2011 debt ceiling crisis</a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>   Through the SOTU, Obama is trying to steer the national debate away from austerity measures, which will restrict economic growth</a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63> The recession in Europe is one example of what happens with extended budget cutting</a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64> Here in the U</a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>S</a>
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>, the economy contracted in the fourth quarter 2012 thanks to cuts in defense spending</a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67> That's because government spending is a component of GDP</a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68> Cut spending, and you cut growth</a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>  If implemented, most of Obama's measures would stimulate growth and job creation</a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70> However, they also need to be balanced with future budget cutting and deficit reduction</a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71> Obama could follow the example of the Federal Reserve's QE4 program, and set a growth and unemployment</a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72> He could quantify budget cuts that will take place once GDP hits 4% and unemployment drops to 6%</a>
<a name="73">[73]</a> <a href="#73" id=73> This would curb economic expansion at the right place in the business cycle, and prevent an asset bubble</a>
<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74> It would also coordinate fiscal policy with monetary policy, making both that much more powerful in preventing both inflation and recession</a>
<a name="75">[75]</a> <a href="#75" id=75></a>
